## Intro

This is a tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript with limited AI capability. 
I created this following the Odin Project's course. 
My aim was to improve my understanding of global scope and the use of modules/factories/IIFE's 
to keep code private and effectively group code.

## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Decription

I first attempted this project following the Odin Project and using only the resources it presented. I failed badly and was completely out of my depth.

After taking a more in-depth course on JavaScript and with a better understanding of modules, factory functions and IIFE's I completed this task. 

I learnt from this project to spend time planning how the app will and consider how modules will communicate, where varaibles are best kept (and in what form; objects, arrays) and how this data will be accessed.

This project really helped me get a better of understanding of JavaScript and where errors were made I always felt capable of finding bugs and solving these issues.

In the future I would like to come back and implement a minimax function to give the AI intelligence but I have put this aside for now for to continute my learning.
